## Numpy implementation of fully connected neural network with several features
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Implementation of fully connected neural which made in style nn.Sequential from PyTorch.

Also implemented the following features:

* Optimizers:
  * Vanilla gradient descent
  * Adam
* Loss functions:
  * MSE
  * Hinge loss
* Activation functions:
  * ReLU
  * Sigmoid
  * Tanh
* Dropout
* L1 and L2 regularizations
* Batch norm
